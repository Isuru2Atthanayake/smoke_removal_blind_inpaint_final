W0202 23:06:43.686993 13884 warnings.py:109] C:\Users\sevitha\anaconda3\envs\smoke\lib\site-packages\pandas\_testing.py:24: FutureWarning: In the future `np.bool` will be defined as the corresponding NumPy scalar.
  import pandas._libs.testing as _testing
An AttributeError occurred: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'bool'.
`np.bool` was a deprecated alias for the builtin `bool`. To avoid this error in existing code, use `bool` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.bool_` here.
The aliases was originally deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance see the original release note at:
    https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations
This could be due to the use of deprecated NumPy aliases.
Consider updating your code to use 'bool' instead of 'np.bool'.
